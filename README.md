Let's Movie Movie
===
I am a movie lover, I go to theater to watch movies 2-3 times a month, so I want to find a way to schedule my movie watchting. Hence this project is coming out.   
It virsually display showtims of movies in specified theater, but now it's only for 'today'. Pick up any showtime to add it to wish list.

The movies data source is from [Google Movie](http://www.google.com/movies), I simply get the web content from that URL, it may blocked by Google if they do not allow.   
I will also provide more data choices from other site e.g.: [Cinemark](http://www.cinemark.com/theatres.aspx), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/)
